## DEIVA: Interactive Visual Analysis of differential gene expression test results

DEIVA (Differential Gene Expression Interactive Visual Analysis) is a web app to interactively identify and locate genes in a hexbin or scatter plot of DESeq2 or edgeR results.

Using DEIVA, domain experts can examine the results of a differential gene expression test and immediately get answers to questions such as "What is the expression level of my genes of interest?", "How does expression of these genes differ between the two different states?", and can easily retrieve lists of genes just by brushing (highlighting) them.

DEIVA visualization conceptualize and prototyped by Anton Kratz.  Project-χ implementation of DEIVA developed by Jayson Harshbarger with inspiration from DESeq2IVA (Shiny version) and significant input from Anton Kratz.
